<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 27, 2025</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>NoteAfloat</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “the App”)
    handles information when you use the NoteAfloat Android application.
</p>

<p>
    By installing or using the App, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described
    in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. App Information</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>App name:</strong> NoteAfloat</li>
    <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Md Abdul Ahad Khan <!--(sole proprietor)--></li>
    <li><strong>Contact email:</strong> noteafloatteam@gmail.com</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>2.1 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
<p>
    We do not collect, store, or transmit personal information such as names, email
    addresses, phone numbers, contact lists, device identifiers, IP addresses,
    location data, or account credentials.
</p>

<h3>2.2 User-Created Content (Notes)</h3>
<p>
    The App allows users to create notes and related content. All notes and related
    data are stored <strong>locally on the user’s device only</strong>.
    We do not collect, upload, sync, or store user notes on any server.
</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — used to deliver reminders that you create. Notification delivery and reminder scheduling are performed on-device; the App will request the relevant runtime permission where required and you may disable notifications at any time.</li>

    <li><strong>Exact alarms</strong> — used only when you add reminders to notes. The App will request and verify the appropriate permission at runtime on devices/OS versions that require it, and will follow Android platform guidance regarding alarm scheduling.</li>

    <li><strong>Camera</strong> — used solely to capture photos for attachment to notes. Captured images are stored locally on your device.</li>

    <li><strong>Microphone and audio recording</strong> — used exclusively to record voice notes; all recordings are stored locally on your device.</li>

    <li><strong>Storage</strong> — used only to persist media (photos, videos, audio) that you create with the App. Storage access is requested according to Android’s scoped-storage model and applicable runtime permission rules.</li>

    <li><strong>Draw over other apps </strong> — used only to display one or two floating assistive buttons that provide quick access to note creation and viewing. The overlay is optional, clearly described in the App UI, and may be disabled by the user or via system settings.</li>

    <li><strong>Foreground service</strong> — used to support ongoing, user-initiated activities such as the overlay. When a foreground service is active a persistent system notification is displayed; you may stop the service at any time.</li>

    <li><strong>Screen capture / Media projection / Background audio recording</strong> — used only to capture screenshots or record the device screen and/or background audio when explicitly requested by the user. Any such captures are performed with user consent and are stored locally. </li>
</ul>
<p>If we add or change permissions, we will update this Privacy Policy and the App’s Data Safety disclosure in the Play Console.</p>



<h3>2.4 Payments and Subscriptions</h3>
<p>
    The App may offer paid subscriptions or in-app purchases. All payments are processed
    exclusively through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    We do not collect or process payment card information. Payment details are handled
    directly by Google in accordance with Google’s own privacy and security policies.
</p>

<h3>2.5 Voluntary Communications</h3>
<p>
    If you contact us via email for support or feedback, you may voluntarily provide
    information such as your email address or message content. This information is used
    solely to respond to your inquiry.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>
    Any information handled by the App is used only for the following purposes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Providing core note-taking functionality</li>
    <li>Displaying notifications and reminders requested by the user</li>
    <li>Enabling paid features through Google Play subscriptions</li>
    <li>Responding to user support requests</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
    At this time, the App does <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics services,
    advertising networks, cloud storage providers, or external SDKs.
</p>

<p>
    Google Play Billing is used solely for payment processing. Use of paid features is
    also subject to Google’s terms and privacy policies.
</p>

<p>
    If third-party services are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated
    to reflect those changes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Data Storage and Deletion</h2>

<p>
    User-created notes remain on the user’s device until they are deleted by the user
    or the App is uninstalled.
</p>

<p>
    Users may delete notes using in-app features or by clearing the App’s data through
    Android system settings. Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data from the
    device.
</p>

<p>
    We cannot delete data that exists only on a user’s device without access to that
    device.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
    NoteAfloat is <strong>not directed to children under the age of 13</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
    <!-- If a parent -->
    <!-- or guardian believes that a child has provided personal information to us, they may
    contact us and we will take reasonable steps to delete such information. -->
</p>

<p>
    The App is intended for general use. Parents and guardians are responsible for
    supervising children’s use of the App and the device.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. User Rights</h2>

<p>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights related to personal data,
    including access, correction, deletion, or restriction of processing.
</p>

<p>
    Because the App stores data locally and collects minimal information, most user
    control can be exercised directly on the device. For developer-held data (such as
    support emails), requests may be sent to our contact email.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Security</h2>

<p>
    We use reasonable measures to protect any information we directly control.
    However, the security of locally stored notes also depends on the security of
    the user’s device.
</p>

<p>
    Users are encouraged to enable device locks, encryption, and backups according to
    their preferences.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. International Use and Governing Law</h2>

<p>
    The App is available to users worldwide. This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws
    of Bangladesh, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
</p>

<p>
    Users in other jurisdictions may have additional rights under applicable local laws.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the
    “Effective date” at the top of this page will be updated.
</p>

<p>
    Continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of
    the revised Privacy Policy.
</p>
